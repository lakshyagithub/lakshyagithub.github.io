If you’ve been a long-time Windows user, you know Notepad as the go-to, no-frills text editor—simple, fast, and reliable for jotting down plain text. But Microsoft is shaking things up! As announced on the Windows Insider Blog, Notepad is getting a significant update with version 11.2504.50.0, introducing lightweight text formatting and Markdown support for Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels on Windows 11. Here’s a closer look at what this update brings and what it means for Notepad users.

### A New Era for Notepad: Lightweight Formatting Arrives
Notepad’s charm has always been its simplicity, but this update adds a layer of flexibility without sacrificing its core appeal. The new formatting toolbar lets you apply bold, italic, hyperlinks, headings, and simple lists to your text. Whether you’re typing notes or drafting content, these features make it easier to structure your work directly in Notepad.

The update also introduces support for Markdown, a lightweight markup language popular among writers and developers. You can now work in Markdown syntax and toggle between formatted and raw views using the View menu or a status bar button. This is a game-changer for anyone who loves Markdown’s clean, portable formatting for creating web-ready content.

Don’t worry if you’re a purist—Microsoft hasn’t forgotten Notepad’s roots. You can clear all formatting via the toolbar or Edit menu, or disable formatting entirely in the app settings, keeping things as minimal as ever when needed.[](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/30/text-formatting-in-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/)

### Why This Matters

This update, rolling out as of May 30, 2025, marks a significant evolution for Notepad, which has remained largely unchanged for nearly 50 years. The addition of formatting and Markdown support positions Notepad as a modern alternative to basic word processors like the now-retired WordPad, while still retaining its lightweight nature. It’s a nod to users who want more functionality without the bloat of heavier apps like Microsoft Word.[](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-notepad-text-formatting-rolling-out/)[](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-now-testing-notepad-text-formatting-in-windows-11/)

However, not everyone is thrilled. Some longtime users value Notepad’s barebones simplicity, using it to strip formatting from copied text or edit code without interference. Social media posts show mixed reactions—some praise the Markdown support for its utility, while others worry Notepad is becoming too feature-heavy, potentially slowing it down or complicating its purpose.[](https://tildes.net/~tech/1ob4/text_formatting_in_notepad_begin_rolling_out_to_windows_insiders)[](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/1kza2dy/text_formatting_in_notepad_begin_rolling_out_to/)

### How to Get Started

If you’re a Windows Insider in the Canary or Dev Channels, update Notepad to version 11.2504.50.0 to try these features. You can enable the formatting support immediately using ViVeTool with the command `vivetool /enable /id:41073112` if the rollout hasn’t reached you yet. Microsoft is also seeking feedback via the Feedback Hub (WIN + F, under Apps > Notepad), so you can share your thoughts to shape future updates.[](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/text-formatting-in-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders-on-windows-11.36599/)[](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/30/text-formatting-in-notepad-begin-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/)

### What’s Next for Notepad?

This update is part of Microsoft’s ongoing effort to modernize Notepad, which began with a redesign in 2021 and continued with features like tabs, spell check, and AI-powered tools like text summarization and rewriting. While some users on platforms like Reddit express skepticism about Notepad becoming a “modern WordPad,” others see the value in a free, lightweight editor that can handle Markdown and basic formatting.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/1kza2dy/text_formatting_in_notepad_begin_rolling_out_to/)[](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-now-testing-notepad-text-formatting-in-windows-11/)

As Microsoft continues to blur the lines between Notepad and more robust text editors, it’s clear they’re aiming to make it a versatile tool for both casual users and professionals. Whether you’re excited about the new features or prefer the classic experience, the option to stick with plain text ensures Notepad remains true to its roots.
